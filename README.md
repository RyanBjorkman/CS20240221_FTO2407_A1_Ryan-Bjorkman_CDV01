1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Time will be a huge factor and challenge as I have both my own business (while mostly passive) does require a few hours each week and I have a new born baby so hard scheduling is a challenge on it's own.
    - Following a routine as best as possible and setting daily/weekly goals and dedicating enough time to accomplish each.
      
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - I know a few other developers already working in the industry with multiple years of experience that may help develop my coding skills as well as introduce me to the right people or at least point me in the right direction.
